                    node index.js
                            |
                process and execute code in index.js file
                            |
                Do we still have work to do? Look at times,  --NO> Exit the program
                        OS tasks, threadpools
                            |
                            Yes
                Run setTimeouts', setInterval's
                            |
                Run callbacks for any os tasks or threadpool
                tasks that are done. (this is 99% of our code)
                            |
                Pause and wait for stuff to happen
                            |
                Run any 'setImmediate' functions
                            |
                Handle close events 
                    (Repeat third step)


The one execution of the event loop is termed as a "Kick".
