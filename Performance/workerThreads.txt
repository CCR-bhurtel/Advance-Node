Options argument
While creating a worker, you can also pass a bunch of configurations to the worker.

argv — Lets you append custom arguments to the original process.argv object
env — Lets you add environment variables specific to a thread.
     These variables are cloned so the parent and the worker thread will have separate copies of these variables.
eval — Lets you evaluate strings as JavaScript expressions.
resourceLimits — Sets resource limits to a worker so that once a worker reaches that limit, it will automatically terminate.
workerData — Data that gets cloned and passed to the worker.
