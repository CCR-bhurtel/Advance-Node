Clustering 
    (Donot use in nodemon; performance issue)
    When running the node index.js,
        At first Cluster Manager starts up
        and the CM starts other worker instances in next go

        Difference between worker threads and child process:
            Different instances of child process cannot communicate with other but that of worker threads can re haii

Benchmarking :- use apache benchmark, hard to configure in windoes so use WSL (ubuntu)
